Main files are in js folder. 

Most of the work is in js/raytrace5.js, with other supporting codes and homeworks for reference from earlier in the semester. 

Clone the repo to local machine, then open index.html to interact with the project.

Experiment with different values of hue count, or turn off Phong shading to see the rainbows more clearly. 

Most of the code, including boilerplate HTML design, are not done by me, and are provided by professor Ken Perlin at NYU. My contributions are mostly in the refraction parts in the fragment shader, including manipulations with color and indices of refraction.
